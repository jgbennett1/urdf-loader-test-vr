                    <p>Welcome to RelaxedIK! This solver implements the methods discussed in our paper <i> RelaxedIK: Real-time Synthesis of Accurate and Feasible Robot Arm Motion </i> (<a href="http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss14/p43.html">http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss14/p43.html</a>)</p>

</ul>

<p>RelaxedIK is an inverse kinematics (IK) solver designed for robot platforms such that the conversion between Cartesian end-effector pose goals (such as &ldquo;move the robot&rsquo;s right arm end-effector to position X, while maintaining an end-effector orientation Y&rdquo;) to Joint-Space (i.e., the robot&rsquo;s rotation values for each joint degree-of-freedom at a particular time-point) is done both ACCURATELY and FEASIBLY.  By this, we mean that RelaxedIK attempts to find the closest possible solution to the desired end-effector pose goals without exhibiting negative effects such as self-collisions, environment collisions, kinematic-singularities, or joint-space discontinuities.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Core</h2>
                    <p>The core part of RelaxedIK is at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_core">relaxed_ik_core</a>. The core contains a Rust implementation of RelaxedIK with both a library crate and a binary crate. The library crate includes all the kinematics libraries of RelaxedIK, while the binary crate is desgined for the purpose of testing. Since the core is not designed to be run independently in general (although it is runnable), please refer to the wrappers section for more information on how to run RelaxedIK.</p>

<p>To introduce relaxed_ik_core, let&rsquo;s first talk about the previous iteration of RelaxedIK at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik/tree/dev">relaxed_ik</a>. There are three parts in this repo: the Rust library of RelaxedIK, a ROS wrapper around it, and a preprocessing toolkit for robot config files needed for RelaxedIK. To make it more convenient to improve RelaxedIK and build all kinds of wrappers around it, we extract the Rust library from that repo to be relaxed_ik_core. Also, to ease the process of setting up a robot arm with RelaxedIK, we decide to exclude the preprocessing toolkit (which is accessible in <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik/tree/dev">relaxed_ik</a>) from relaxed_ik_core and instead provide all of the pre-generated config files for some mostly used robot manipulators. The list of available robots include baxter, hubo, iiwa7, jaco7, panda, sawyer, ur5, and yumi. Generally, this version <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik/tree/dev">relaxed_ik</a> is only recommended if you would like to work on the configuration process yourself or set up a robot that we didn&rsquo;t include in the available options. In that version, you will have the opportunity to (and will have to) set up everything from scratch, including importing a urdf, configuring the collision files, and training the neural network, etc. If you&rsquo;re working on a robot for which we provided config files, relaxed_ik_core and its wrappers are likely to make your life much easier since setting the name of the robot you would like to run in <code>relaxed_ik_core/config/loaded_robot</code> will almost be everything you need to do to work with relaxe_ik_core. You will still have the flexibility to change the initial joint configuration in the corresponding info file in <code>relaxed_ik_core/config/info_files</code>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wrappers</h2>
                    

<p>Although the core is runnable, it is usually not intended to be run alone. Wrappers are required to connect RelaxedIK to different interfaces. Here are 5 wrappers that we implemented for ROS, ROS2, CoppeliaSim, Mujoco, and Unity respectively. Each wrapper has detailed instructions on how to work with them in the README in their repo. If you are interested, it is possible to wrap up the core in other interfaces as well.</p>

<h3 id="relaxed-ik-ros">Relaxed IK ROS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Available at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_ros1">relaxed_ik_ros1</a>.</li>
<li>This is a lighter-weight version of RelaxedIK wrapped up in ROS1. A keyboard pose goal driver and a rviz viewer are included in this wrapper for you to play with. You can treat this wrapper as a new iteration over <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik/tree/dev">relaxed_ik</a>.</li>
<li>Please refer to the README in the repo for more infomation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relaxed-ik-ros2-under-developed">Relaxed IK ROS2 (Under developed)</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is RelaxedIK wrapped up in ROS2.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relaxed-ik-coppeliasim">Relaxed IK CoppeliaSim</h3>

<ul>
<li>Available at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_coppeliasim">relaxed_ik_coppeliasim</a>.</li>
<li>This is a RelaxedIK plugin for CoppeliaSim. Although it&rsquo;s possible to use RelaxedIK in CoppeliaSim via ROS and the ROS wrapper of RelaxedIK at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_ros1">relaxed_ik_ros1</a>, it might be more convenient to directly access RelaxedIK in the form of a CoppeliaSim Pluggin. That&rsquo;s why we developed this wrapper.</li>
<li>Please refer to the README in the repo for more infomation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relaxed-ik-mujoco">Relaxed IK Mujoco</h3>

<ul>
<li>Available at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_mujoco">relaxed_ik_mujoco</a>.</li>
<li>This is a RelaxedIK wrapper for Mujoco.</li>
<li>Please refer to the README in the repo for more infomation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relaxed-ik-unity">Relaxed IK Unity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Available at <a href="https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_unity">relaxed_ik_unity</a>.</li>
<li>This is the Unity wrapper of RelaxedIK designed to be run on Windows. Note that it probably won&rsquo;t work on a linux machine. The simulation of a few commonly used robot arms have already been set up for you to play with. You will be able to disable and enable RelaxedIK as you like. When RelaxedIK is disabled, a joint angle writer panel will show up for you to modify the joint angle configuration. When RelaxedIK is enabled, you will be able to have real-time interactions with the robot and RelaxedIK by dragging the transform gizmo associated with the gripper of the robot. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like currently:</li>
</ul>
